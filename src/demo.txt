Hey, are you okay, dude? You don't. You don't look okay.
I can stay here for a bit. I don't want you to freak out.
I really like I'm kind of busy though. I do have to leave. I'm sorry. Bye.
I have to go. I'm leaving now. The leaves at the stage.
Okay, I'm back. How is your summer bin, man? Like you really do not like I want you to feel alright. I want you to feel alright.
Of course man, I love you dude. I love you.
Of course, always man. I mean looking out for another person is like really what I'm all about.
